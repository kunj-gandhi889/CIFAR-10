# CIFAR-10
CIFAR-10 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION APP IN STREAMLIT
CIFAR-10 Dataset is a collection of 60000 32x32 color images distributed equally in 10 classes, 6000 images per classes.
50000 training samples and 10000 testing samples. Dataset is divided in 5 training batches and 1 test batch, each with 10000 images.
Training samples contains 5000 images per class and testing samples contains 1000 images per class.
Classes are mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks which look similar.
Commonly Used in Machine Learning and Computer Vision Algorithms.

Majorily Deep Learning Algorithms give more accuracy above 80-85% , in this repo i have tried to perform classification using Several Machine learning algorithms and using different ensemble techniques.

I have also compared the accuracy of every classifier to identify how different classifier predict on data.
